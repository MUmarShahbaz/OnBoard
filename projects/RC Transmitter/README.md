# RC Transmitter

A Arduino and NRF24L01 based Transmitter that can be reused across multiple projects. I want to make it so that I can use it with my own RC Cars, Boats, Helicopters...... The reciever will be made using an Arduino Nano with an Expansion Sheild and the NRF24LO1 Reciever module.

PCB alone costs 8.40$. It costs approximately 50 usd dollars (components incl.) excluding shipping. Since I am from Pakistan, shipping is arround 30 dollars from US to PK bringing the grand total to around 80 usd.
