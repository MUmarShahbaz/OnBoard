1. Arduino Pro Mini 5V - The board requires a special variant which doesn't have a name, look for an image at the end
2. MPU6050 Gyroscope module
3. NRF24L01 + PA + LA variant (the one with the antennea, and is longest)
4. AMS1117 Power Regulator
5. 2* 3 Pin Toggle Switch
6. 2* Joystich Modules (remove the breakout board)

You can leave the Power Switch, Potentiometers, Pushbuttons (that are without the joystick) and Capacitors to me

You can find a PDF containing the bill from my local shop of the esitimate
